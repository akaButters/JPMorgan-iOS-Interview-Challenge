# JPMorgan's iOS Coding Challenge
This was my submission to JPMorgan's code challenge prior to an interview.

It represents my solution to asynchronously fetching JSON data from an endpoint. It uses programmatic UI, separation of concerns, a MVVM approach, unit tests, and a Mock web service.

You are welcome to use it or learn from it in any way that you like.
